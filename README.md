In the above picture, can notice four rows of seats labelled as A, B, C and D, and it is 
important to note that these rows have varying seat capacities (either 12 or 14 seats). Seats 
are coded according to their row and seat number and have different prices according to their 
colour. For example, the seat marked with an ‘X’ is considered seat B2 and costs £200.
